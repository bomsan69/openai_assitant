ONE,"There is discrimination and malice against eating alone. Today I walked in alone, and the waiter told me that their store policy is that if you eat for one person you have to pay 40 per person instead of 30. But I don't see this explicit rule anywhere. If you don't want to serve a person, you can just say, there is no need to discriminate against a person to eat. Not everyone in the world likes to eat with others.","Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

FIVE,"Solid meal deal with the 40$ all you can eat. You can add sides like a steamed egg bowl for 1$. Everything I ate was delicious pretty standard with kbbq taste. The side dishes included classics like Kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumber, they also had a potato salad side that included corn and that I was surprised it was great! I‚Äôd say my only fret was it was busy on a Sunday night which is to be expected.they have a 100 minute table limit but it‚Äôs not like your gonna take 2 whole hours to eat. It‚Äôs super trendy on the inside they had a robotic cat waiter rolling around pretty dope. I was a big fan on how they added gratuity with your check so my total meal for all you can eat including a 1$ side of steam egg dish was 54$. Definitely a group activity! I loved the scenery as well each group table had a tv with a scenery setting which illuminated the vibe. The kimchi wasn‚Äôt spicy enough to make you cry but nonetheless delicious. (I love to cry eating spicy foods)","Thank you for your kind words about Seol Grille! We are thrilled to hear that you had a great experience and enjoyed the all you can eat meal deal.
