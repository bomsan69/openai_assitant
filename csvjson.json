The side dishes included classics like Kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumber, they also had a potato salad side that included corn and that I was surprised it was great! I‚Äôd say my only fret was it was busy on a Sunday night which is to be expected.they have a 100 minute table limit but it‚Äôs not like your gonna take 2 whole hours to eat. It‚Äôs super trendy on the inside they had a robotic cat waiter rolling around pretty dope. I was a big fan on how they added gratuity with your check so my total meal for all you can eat including a 1$ side of steam egg dish was 54$. Definitely a group activity! I loved the scenery as well each group table had a tv with a scenery setting which illuminated the vibe. The kimchi wasn‚Äôt spicy enough to make you cry but nonetheless delicious. (I love to cry eating spicy foods)",
