ONE,"There is discrimination and malice against eating alone. Today I walked in alone, and the waiter told me that their store policy is that if you eat for one person you have to pay 40 per person instead of 30. But I don't see this explicit rule anywhere. If you don't want to serve a person, you can just say, there is no need to discriminate against a person to eat. Not everyone in the world likes to eat with others.","Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

FIVE,"Solid meal deal with the 40$ all you can eat. You can add sides like a steamed egg bowl for 1$. Everything I ate was delicious pretty standard with kbbq taste. The side dishes included classics like Kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumber, they also had a potato salad side that included corn and that I was surprised it was great! I’d say my only fret was it was busy on a Sunday night which is to be expected.they have a 100 minute table limit but it’s not like your gonna take 2 whole hours to eat. It’s super trendy on the inside they had a robotic cat waiter rolling around pretty dope. I was a big fan on how they added gratuity with your check so my total meal for all you can eat including a 1$ side of steam egg dish was 54$. Definitely a group activity! I loved the scenery as well each group table had a tv with a scenery setting which illuminated the vibe. The kimchi wasn’t spicy enough to make you cry but nonetheless delicious. (I love to cry eating spicy foods)","Thank you for your kind words about Seol Grille! We are thrilled to hear that you had a great experience and enjoyed the all you can eat meal deal.

FIVE,"Was in Raleigh for a week for work and decided to try this place out. I had never had Korean BBQ before and was particularly interested in this place, and I was not disappointed. The place is "divided" into what seems to be four segments; the restaurant, the Korean "snack" section, the grocery store, and the K-pop store. Upon entering I was able to order my food fairly easy and quick, I got spicy short ribs, and while my food cooked I browsed around the shop. The food was exceptional and after eating I went back and purchased several snack items. If you're interested in trying Korean BBQ for the first time or just looking for a new experience, definitely check out this hidden gem!","Thank you for your kind words!

The vibes are great but the AYCE menu is a bit disappointing and I did not like the steamed egg which is not included in the price. It seemed a bit bland but they have good side dishes so pros and cons. I worked at a kbbq in clt so maybe it's a personal preference. I would probably try out their other menus next time instead. Definitely worth trying out if you've never had kbbq.","Thank you for your kind review! We are delighted that you enjoyed the service and the atmosphere at Seol Grille.

FIVE,"Great food, service, and atmosphere!! Music was a little loud, but the Korean BBQ really hit it out of the park. The price point is amazing as well compared to other Korean BBQ joints in the area. We had a party of 6 on a Saturday night and only had a 10 minute wait. They have tons of tables and a great system to cycle groups through quickly. Can't wait to eat here again!","Thank you for taking the time to leave such kind words!
